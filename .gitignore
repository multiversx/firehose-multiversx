# To facilitate development, you can use [direnv](https://direnv.net/) to auto-load
# some environment variables. We have in `devel` a shim script called directly `firemultiversx`
# (that should have been renamed to your specific chain like `fireeth`). This small shim
# compiles the project and then invoke resulting binary. This means that when using this
# .envrc file:
#
# ```
# export PATH="`pwd`/devel:$PATH"
# ```
#
# Each time you enter the project in your terminal (e.g. `cd ~/work/firehose-firemultiversx`) and then
# do `firehose start --help`, then it first compiles all the Go source code and then invoke the
# resulting just compiled binary, meaning you are "always" freshly compiled, it's more or less
# equivalent to doing directly `go run ./cmd/firemultiversx start --help` (which is totally fine).
